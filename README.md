**Russian roulette** (***Rússkaya rulétka***) is a potentially lethal game of chance 🎲  
in which a player places a ***single round*** 🔴 in a ***revolver*** 🔫,  
spins the cylinder 🌀, places the muzzle against the head or body  
(their opponent's or their own),  
and pulls the trigger 👉.

If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel after  
cocking (with a single-action revolver),  
or is in the position which will be rotated to the barrel upon pulling the  
trigger (double-action),  
the weapon fires 💥.
